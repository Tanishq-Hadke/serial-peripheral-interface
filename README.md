# Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) – FPGA Design using Vivado

This repository contains the design and implementation of the **Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)** protocol using **Verilog HDL** in **Xilinx Vivado**.  
The project demonstrates SPI communication suitable for FPGA-based embedded systems.

## 📌 Overview

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a synchronous serial communication protocol widely used for short-distance communication between a master and one or more slave devices.

This design focuses on:
- SPI Master implementation
- Full-duplex data transfer
- Configurable clock and data modes

---

## ⚙️ Features

- SPI Master architecture
- Supports MOSI and MISO data transfer
- Configurable Clock Polarity (CPOL)
- Configurable Clock Phase (CPHA)
- Chip Select (CS) control
- Synthesizable Verilog design
- Compatible with Basys 3 / Artix-7 FPGA boards

## 🧩 SPI Signals

| Signal | Direction | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| SCLK | Output | Serial Clock generated by master |
| MOSI | Output | Master Out Slave In |
| MISO | Input  | Master In Slave Out |
| CS   | Output | Chip Select (Active Low) |
| CLK  | Input  | System clock |
| RST  | Input  | Active-high reset |
